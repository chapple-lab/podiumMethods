Description: This package contains methods not included in the PODIUM package. In conjunction with the PODIUM package, adds 
			 functional support for analysis of stable-isotope labeling data where the labeled portion of the tracer molecule remains intact. 
			 Contains methods that are not directly involved in modifying/extending XCMS (ie. non-xcmsSet2 specific methods).  
			 These methods may eventually get merged together with the podium package.
