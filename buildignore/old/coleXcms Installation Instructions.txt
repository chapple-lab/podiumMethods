coleXcms Installation Instructions

1. Install R-3.0.2
  - https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/3.0.2/
  - (link is for windows binaries)

2. Install R Tools
  - https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
  - Install version 31: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/Rtools31.exe
  - Make sure choose to add R Tools to your PATH during install
  - R Tools is necessary in order to install packages from source that contain non-R Code
    (in this case the coleXcms package)

3. Install XCMS via Bioconductor
  - Note: This step is OPTIONAL but is an easy way of automatically installing all of the
    necessary dependencies for the coleXcms package (as they are the same as for the XCMS package)
  - This requires the usage of the old installation method (see following)
  - Open R and run > source('http://www.bioconductor.org/biocLite.R')
  - Next run > biocLite('xcms')
  - XCMS and its dependencies should now be installed

4. Install the coleXcms package
  - With R open run > install.packages('C:/path/to/tarball/coleXcms_1.1.0.tar.gz',type='source',repos=NULL)

5. Install the coleXcmsMethods package
  - Open R and run > install.packages('C:/path/to/tarball/coleXcmsMethods_0.1.1.tar.gz',type='source',repos=NULL)

You are now ready to run!  You can use the provided script which will automatically load the required packages
and analyze any data you provide.  Please see included instructions on how to run coleXcms and the included script.

If you want to run coleXcms with your own script, you will need to first load the coleXcms and coleXcmsMethods
packages before starting your analysis.
